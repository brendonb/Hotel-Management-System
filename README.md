- <b>The application demo's the role of the end user and systems administrator,
  and is in applied information system that utilises,adding,editing and searching custormer information,<b>
-<b>Other features include linking payments to the customers, applying basic analytics like finding the average customers in the database</b>
  and searching for information regarding the customer, the application allows you to print reports to pdf and csv.As for riskmanagement
  the application audits payment field changes with timestamp information to review.The system administator can controll the backend of the application
  by adding,removing or editing the users of the system,apply permission to screens and do database backups and restores</b>
- <b>Finally this application though not 100% complete gave me a deeper insght into the world of development, a challenging problem i faced was parsing usernames between different classes
  which prior created loops in my program while transition between classes so that i can manipulate mysql queries to perform some tasks whereby i needed the username</b>

<b>Last but not least im hoping to refine this app next year and make everything more efficient ,like applying DRY principles and reading up about more code best practices<b>
